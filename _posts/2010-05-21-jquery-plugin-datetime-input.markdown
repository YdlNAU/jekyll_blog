jQuery Plugin - Date/Time Input
===============================

I needed a simple, intuitive date time selector and couldn't find an exact match for what I was wanting to do.

So I wrote this simple jQuery plugin to take a normal input field containing 24-hour formatted time (HH:MM:SS), and create options for the selection of hour, minute, AM/PM, updating the user's selection back to 24 hour format in the input field, which the plugin will hide by default.

One thing I noticed while coding this - the 12-hour clock system is very non-intuitive, at least compared to the 24-hour system which just goes 00:00:00 - 23:59:59. <a title="24/12 hour clock confusion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Confusion_at_noon_and_midnight">Read this to see what I mean.</a>

At any rate, the plugin works for me.

Enjoy, and let me know of any bugs or improvements.
